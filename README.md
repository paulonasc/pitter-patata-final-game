# Potato-Project

Pitter Patata is a game that was heavily influenced by the popular game, The Escapists: Prison Escape. Like The Escapists, Pitter Patata is a fast-paced and strategic game that puts players on the edge of their seats. However, instead of escaping from a prison, players take on the role of a potato trying to escape from humans.

In 2022, scientists conducted experiments on potatoes. Little did they know, the potatoes would come to life. Pitter Patata follows the life of a potato trying to escape from humans after discovering the atrocities they have committed on potatoes for thousands of years. As a potato, you have to collect your fellow potato friends which are in buckets, and escape from the humans.

One unique feature of Pitter Patata is the ability to collect potato buckets throughout the map. These buckets are necessary to proceed to the next level, and players must collect them while avoiding humans and other obstacles. Additionally, the game has time limits in each level, so players must act quickly in order to escape before time runs out. Pitter Patata also includes portals that can be used to dodge humans and make a successful escape.

Pitter Patata is available on PC, Mac, and Linux platforms, and has a rating of E for Everyone. The game was officially launched on December 15, 2022, and has received positive reviews from players for its engaging gameplay and unique concept.
